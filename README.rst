Configr
=======


Synopsis
--------

This small utility library helps managing global or per-user configuration data for your apps.
Installation through pip will install the appdirs package, but the code may be used without any external dependencies as well.


Code Example
------------

Simple use::

    import configr
    cfg = configr.Configr("myapp")
    cfg.a = "Value of A"
    print cfg["a"]


Motivation
----------

This library helps solving a common problem found in many apps: simple configuration (file) handling.


Installation
------------

Using pip::

    pip install configr

Using setup.py (usually elevated rights are needed, e.g. via ``sudo`` (Linux) or ``runas`` (Windows))::

    python setup.py install


API reference
-------------

The Configr object has the following functions::

    __init__(_, name, data = {}, defaults = {})
    loadSettings(_, defaults = {}, location = None, ignores = [])
    SaveSetings(_, keys = None, location = None)

Additionally the object supports dictionary and attribute style access (the latter of couse only for keys that start with an alphabetic character or underscore).


Tests
-----

The tool provides unit tests through the doctest module and integration tests through the unittest module.


Contributors
------------

This library is currently developed by Arne Bachmann.
