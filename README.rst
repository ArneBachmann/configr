Synopsis
--------

This small utility library helps managing global or per-user configuration for your Python apps.
Installation through ``pip`` will install the ``appdirs`` package as a dependency, but the code may be used without any external dependencies as well.


Code Example
------------

Simple use::

    >>> import configr
    >>> cfg = configr.Configr("myapp")
    >>> cfg.a = "Value of A"
    >>> print cfg["a"]
    Value of A


Motivation
----------

This library helps solving a common problem found in many apps: simplified configuration/settings/preset handling.


Installation
------------

Using pip::

    pip install configr

Using setup.py (usually elevated rights are needed, e.g. via ``sudo`` (Linux) or ``runas`` (Windows))::

    python setup.py install


API reference
-------------

The Configr object has the following functions::

    __init__(_, name, data = {}, defaults = {})  # Constructor. "data" initializes the configuration, while "defaults" contains fallback values not explicity set on the configuration data.
    saveSettings(_, keys = None, location = None)  # Persist the configuration. "keys" limits the entries written. "location" is a file system path
    loadSettings(_, data = {}, location = None, ignores = [])  # load configuration. "data" is used if its key is not found in the file. "ignores" are keys to not load. location" is a file system path

Configr object supports dictionary and attribute style access to get or set entries.
Both "loadSettings" and "saveSettings" support an additional "clientCodeLocation" parameter to allow passing a path to further separated several installation locations of the same app on a single file system. This allows to separate settings for each installation, if they are placed in different directories.


Building, packaging and distribution
------------------------------------

Run ``python setup.py build install`` locally, or ``python setup.py build sdist upload -r https://www.python.org/pypi`` to upload the package to PyPI/Warehouse.
New: ``twine upload dist/*.tar.gz`` (choose youngest version)
